# Algorithmic-Trading---Cryptocurrencies

Market Scrapers: Each scraper reads market data from the Cryptsy cryptocurrency exchange for the following coins:
Peercoin, Bitshares, Dogecoin, Darkcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple. All exchange rates are denominated Bitcoins.

The bitcoin scraper's prices are denominated in USD from bitstamp. 

Currently, each scraper creates a separate csv file in your home folder (if run in ubuntu) titled by the name of each currency.
